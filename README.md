Proiect final Scoala Informala
This is a small Console App made as my final Assignment from .NET Development Course.
The main purpose was to simulate the process of developing a real software that could be used in a Police Department for managing driver tickets.

Main functionality is:
1. On start, to be able to load data from file or create a new data if there are none other existent file.
2. Add an agent to data base/list.
3. Remove an agent from data base/list.
4. Add a ticket.
5. Remove a ticket.
6. List all tickets by drivers.
7. List all tickets by agentds.
8. List all the tickets by agent, calculate its toals and sort them by value, in descendent order.
9. Save data on exit or on other events.

Each Agent has an unique ID.
Each Driver has a vehicle cathegory and a fine for each ticket.
